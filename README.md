## Availability zones 
An AWS region is a geographical location which contains a number of Availability Zones (data centers).

Splitting the AWS network into regions is necessary for data complience, and for optimising low latency for users.

An availability zone is a data center that is located within the region, there are two or more availability zones in each region. 
To enhance availability and reduce the risk of two data centers experiencing an outage at the same time, each AZ has a seperate redundant power and netoworking setup.
