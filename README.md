# AWS Global Infrastructure 

## Availability zones 
An AWS region is a geographical location which contains a number of Availability Zones (data centers).

Splitting the AWS network into regions is necessary for data complience, and for optimising low latency for users.

An availability zone is a data center that is located within the region, there are two or more availability zones in each region. 
To enhance availability and reduce the risk of two data centers experiencing an outage at the same time, each AZ has a seperate redundant power and netoworking setup.

## Four pillars of Cloud Computing

### Ease of use
AWS cloud has extensive official documentation for how to use it and most of it is at a very high level of abstraction, which makes it highly accessible and ensures ease of use 

### Robustness
AWS cloud offers many ways of increasing the robustness of your systems, including auto scaling groups, redundancy, constant monitoring and alert management, and backups

### Flexibility
Cloud services allow for fast dynamic changes to deployment of systems and software. It also allows for the services to accessed in a variety of ways (eg. from terminal or web browser)

### Cost
The cost effectiveness of cloud services cannot be understated as you pay only for what you use, and can set up systems to scale down when not being used.
